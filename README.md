The app was built using Flutter and Dart for the frontend and logic. Here's an overview of the process:

1.Core Features: Integrated the Google Maps API to allow users to interact with a live map. Created custom marker functionality where users can edit personalized map markers. Enabled saving marker details, such as titles, descriptions, and custom icons.

2.State Management: Used Riverpod for managing app state, which allowed seamless communication between different parts of the app.

3.Syncing: For cloud-based storage and cross-device syncing, I integrated Firebase.

4.Monetization: Used RevenueCat for managing subscriptions, enabling users to pay for premium features such as cloud sync and unlimited markers.
